### Approach

I have tried SQL injection with username as admin and it failed tried searching for the username but I couldn't find it either. The second approach was inspecting the web page and getting the source code. The html and css code seem pretty normal but I tried to reverse engineer the javascript code.

```jsx
(async()=>{await new Promise((e=>window.addEventListener("load",e))),
document.querySelector("form").addEventListener("submit",
(e=>{e.preventDefault();const r={u:"input[name=username]",
p:"input[name=password]"},
t={};for(const e in r)t[e]=btoa(document.querySelector(r[e]).value).replace(/=/g,"");
return"YWRtaW4"!==t.u?alert("Incorrect Username"):"cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ"!==t.p?alert("Incorrect Password"):void alert(`Correct Password! Your flag is ${atob(t.p)}.`)}))})();
```

Try to read this messy chunk of code to find this snippet:

```jsx
alert("Incorrect Username"):"cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ"!==t.p?alert("Incorrect Password"):void alert(`Correct Password! Your flag is ${atob(t.p)}
```

> cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ
> 

try to decode using any online base64 decoder or simply in the console of the chrome developer tools, write the following:

```jsx
atob('cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ')
```

To get the flag.

Its an easy challenge if you try things a bit differently rather than trying to perform sql injection.
