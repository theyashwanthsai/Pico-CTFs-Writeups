### Approach

After clicking the link and opening the website, we see an simple webpage. I tried to inspect the webpage and get the source code. The html and css files seem normal.

I tried going to the robots.txt path 

[https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/robots.txt](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/robots.txt)

and found this:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /8028f.html
```

Now, the hint given mentioned about the part of the website the creator doesn't want us to look, which must be the 8028.html path.

We are greeted with the flag itself…
