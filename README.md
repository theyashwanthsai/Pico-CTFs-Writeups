# picoGym-CTFs-Writeups
Wrtieups for various CTFs I have solved in the non-competetive picoGym.
This repo consits of all the learnings I had while doing challenges from picoGym Practice Challenges.
This repository is a documentation of my journey practicing CTFs in [picoCT](https://play.picoctf.org/practice) picoGym. This repository is for educational purpose only. Please dont spoil the fun of CTFs by simply copying the flags. Try to use these writeups as hints to reach your goal.
